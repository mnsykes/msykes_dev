							I'm a new developer looking for my first job. After spending most of my adult life
							working dead-end jobs, I decided that I owed it to both myself and my family to find a
							career that would bring me fulfillment and happiness. I took an HTML course in my
							twenties and I remembered how much I enjoyed it. Almost 20 years after taking that
							class I made the decision to dive in head first for a mid-life career change to become
							a developer, and I enrolled in the Information Technology at UMass Lowell for the
							Spring 2020 semester. I earned my degree this spring and it wouldn't have been
							possible without the support from my family; especially my wife, who has been there
							through thick and thin and has encouraged me to succeed every step of the way.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I was able to take a variety of courses at UMass that included: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
							jQuery, SQL, ColdFusion, Python, and C.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Beyond school, I have spent time learning Gatsby, React, and Django to name a few
							things. Any free moment I have is spent trying to learn more about development:
							whether it's watching a Udemy course while washing dishes, listening to a podcast in
							the car, or reading a book waiting to see the doctor, I'm constantly trying to do
							whatever I can to reach my goal of becoming a developer.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							When I'm not watching YouTube tutorials, reading docs, thinking about code, or trying
							to learn something new you'll find me spending time with my family.
