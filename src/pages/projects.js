						<h3>ECBL: Final Project for Intro to HTML course</h3>
						<h3>Stack: HTML, CSS, jQuery</h3>
						<br />
						<p>
							This was the final project for my intro to HTML course and it was the first website
							that I made. The site is for a fictitious basketball league. It was built with HTML
							and CSS. I was also taking an intro to JavaScript at the time so I included some of
							the jQuery that I had learned up to that point. The only links that are live on the
							site are for the Providence Roosters. All team pages would have been the same so I was
							only required to complete all the pages for one team as an example. Because the site
							was never meant to be anything except for an school project, I used player names and
							images from the 2019 Providence Friars basketball team. I'm currently in the process
							refactoring the site using GatsbyJS to make it a better showpiece for my skills. In
							it's current state it is completely unresponsive and breaks on smaller screens.

							This is a simple diary app, but it essentially functions the same way a to-do app
							would (because doesn't everybody have to include a to-do app in their portfolio? âœ”).
							Type an entry into the text area, hit submit, and your entry is stored in the box
							below. That's all there is to it.
