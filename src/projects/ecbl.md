This was the final project for my intro to HTML course and it was the first website
that I made. The site is for a fictitious basketball league. It was built with HTML
and CSS. I was also taking an intro to JavaScript at the time so I included some of
the jQuery that I had learned up to that point. The only links that are live on the
site are for the Providence Roosters. All team pages would have been the same so I was
only required to complete all the pages for one team as an example. Because the site
was only intended to be a school project, I used player names and
images from the 2019 Providence Friars basketball team. I'm currently in the process
refactoring the site using GatsbyJS to make it a better showpiece for my skills. In
it's current state it is completely unresponsive and breaks on smaller screens.

**This project was for academic purposes.**
