In this project we were tasked with redesigning a site of a non-profit organization.
The one I chose is a farm called <a href="https://seedsofsolidarity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
Seeds of Solidarity</a> that's located in Western Massachusetts. They used a simple WordPress theme so for my
redesign I attempted to make the site look a little more modern while still staying
true to the simplicity of the original site. I spent a lot of time looking at their site during my redesign and they seem like a
really great organization. If you ever find yourself in the North Quabbin area of
Massachusetts you should definitely stop by their and show your support.

**This project was for academic purposes.**
